# Python implementation of Hierarchies of Abstract Machine (HAM) as a python coroutine.

Hierarchies of Abstract Machine, also known as HAM, is a framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) which was first introduced in [this paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1997/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf)(Parr & Russell, 1997).

HAM is essentially a finite state machine which could be easily implemented with coroutine in python. However, the limitation of coroutine makes it hard for users to integrate HAM with existing, popular RL algorithm implementation.

:construction: The project is still in progress.
